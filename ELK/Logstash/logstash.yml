# ------------ Data path ------------------
#
# Which directory should be used by logstash and its plugins
# for any persistent needs. Defaults to LOGSTASH_HOME/data

path.data: /var/lib/logstash

# ------------ Dead-Letter Queue Settings --------------
# Flag to turn on dead-letter queue.

dead_letter_queue.enable: true

# If using dead_letter_queue.enable: true, the maximum size of each dead letter queue. Entries
# will be dropped if they would increase the size of the dead letter queue beyond this setting.
# Default is 1024mb
dead_letter_queue.max_bytes: 1024mb

# If using dead_letter_queue.enable: true, the interval in milliseconds where if no further events eligible for the DLQ
# have been created, a dead letter queue file will be written. A low value here will mean that more, smaller, queue files
# may be written, while a larger value will introduce more latency between items being "written" to the dead letter queue, and
# being available to be read by the dead_letter_queue input when items are written infrequently.
# Default is 5000.

dead_letter_queue.flush_interval: 5000

# If using dead_letter_queue.enable: true, controls which entries should be dropped to avoid exceeding the size limit.
# Set the value to `drop_newer` (default) to stop accepting new events that would push the DLQ size over the limit.
# Set the value to `drop_older` to remove queue pages containing the oldest events to make space for new ones.
#
# dead_letter_queue.storage_policy: drop_newer

# If using dead_letter_queue.enable: true, the interval that events have to be considered valid. After the interval has
# expired the events could be automatically deleted from the DLQ.
# The interval could be expressed in days, hours, minutes or seconds, using as postfix notation like 5d,
# to represent a five days interval.
# The available units are respectively d, h, m, s for day, hours, minutes and seconds.
# If not specified then the DLQ doesn't use any age policy for cleaning events.
#
# dead_letter_queue.retain.age: 1d

# If using dead_letter_queue.enable: true, the directory path where the data files will be stored.
# Default is path.data/dead_letter_queue

path.dead_letter_queue: /usr/share/logstash/data/dead_letter_queue
